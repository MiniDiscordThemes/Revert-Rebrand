## Install

Download
[this file](https://github.com/Snare-Hawk/Revert-Rebrand/releases/latest/download/dev.replugged.RevertRebrand.asar)
to the themes folder.

Windows: `%APPDATA%\replugged\themes`
Linux: `~/.config/replugged/themes`

## Troubleshooting

### Make sure Replugged is installed and running.

Open Discord settings and make sure the Replugged tab is there. If not,
[follow these instructions](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installation) to install
Replugged.

### Make sure the theme is installed.

Check the [theme folder](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installing-plugins-and-themes)
for your OS and make sure the theme is there. If not, make sure you have built the theme and that
the `NO_INSTALL` environment variable is not set.  
You can run `replugged.themes.list().then(console.log)` in the console to see a list of themes in
the theme folder.

## Credits

This theme is "inspired by" (I imported the CSS directly from it.) from Ducko's
[GT-Revert-Rebrand theme](https://github.com/Goose-Nest/GT-RevertRebrand). Also, the old Discord
font, that happened to be in the [theme template](https://github.com/replugged-org/theme-template),
is also imported to this theme. Shout-outs to [Ducko](https://github.com/CanadaHonk) and
[Overimagine](https://github.com/Overimagine1)!
